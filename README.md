# NetPuppy
A CLI tool for making and/ or binding TCP connections. Inspired by [Netcat](https://netcat.sourceforge.net/) & written in Golang!
## Goals
NetPuppy will be able to:
- listen for & serve incoming TCP connections as well as initiate outgoing ones
- maintain a stable connections b/w both parties
- send and receive data from either endpoint
- initiate a 'helper shell' on the client peer
## Use:
NetPuppy has two primary modes: offense & connect-back.
### Offense
The 'offensive' peer is executed as a server and listens to the `0.0.0.0` address and a specified port. It will bind incoming TCP connections to that port.
### Connect-Back
The 'connect-back' peer starts w/ a client-like relationship to the offense peer. I.e. it will connect to the address and port you give it. Additionally, if you give the `--shell` flag, it will start a bash process on the local machine. This shell will take input from the offensive peer (via the socket) and execute the input as commands on the machine its running on. The output from the shell will then be echoed back to the offensive peer.
#### Flags:
- `-H` the host IP address you want to connect to (in connect-back mode)
- `-p` the port you want to start your peer on (both mode types)
- `-l` tell NetPuppy to listen, this will start NP in the offense mode. You can also give a port number.
- `--shell` tell NetPuppy to start a bash shell on the client peer which will take socket input as stdin and output stdout/stderr back into the socket.
## Examples:
### Offense Peer:
```
$ go run main.go -l -p 44444

... <banner>          

    *sneef sneef*
   .-.
  / (_          |Host:  0.0.0.0
 ( "  6\___o    |RPort: 44444
 /  (  ___/     |LPort: 44444
/     /  U      |Mode:  Offensive Server
```
### Connect-Back Peer:
```
$ go run main.go -H 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 -p 44444

...<banner>

        bork!
     __  /     |Host:  0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
(___()'';      |RPort: 44444
/ )   /'       |LPort: 60804
/\'--/\        |Mode:  Client
```

# Install Plugins
- when you're running netpuppy you can install a plugin by typing ```install``` to run the installer and then the name of the plugin. you can either type ```name_of_plugin``` or ```name_of_plugin.go```. After installing you may need to restart netpuppy for it to work.

# Changing plugin store
- In netpuppy you can change the plugin store by editing plugins/install.go and changing the github repo to your own url. for example: ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<repo_username>/<repo_name>/<branch>```

- make sure all the go plugins you create are in the root directory of your repo.
